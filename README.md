### Top Starting Locations:

Description:
The top starting locations are in highly populated areas, high tourist traffic areas, and areas with high business traffic. As you move out of Mahhattan into the other boroughs, there is still use of the bikes but it is not as prominent of an area as Manhattan. The key takeaway of this is that the bikes should be placed in areas with high traffic, where people are relying heavily on public transportation or walking to get to their destinations and the trip durations that they are taking are shorter distances.

### Top Ending Locations:

Description:
The top ending locations are also in highly populated areas, and the pattern mimics that of the top starting locations. The key takeaway of this is that the bikes should be placed in areas with high traffic, where people are relying heavily on public transportation or walking to get to their destinations and the trip durations that they are taking are shorter distances. People are using the bikes mainly in these areas to quickly get from one part of a city to another.

### Trips by Weekdays

Description: 
The bikes have the highest use during the morning and evening commutes during the Weekdays and have the highest use betwen 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. on weekends. This means that commuters are relying on the bikes during the weekday and that on the weekends the bikes are being used for more leisurely purposes.

Description: 
Males are the largest gender group using the bikes. As with the trips by weekdays the peak use duringthe weekdays is during commuter times (6 a.m - 9 a.m.) and on weekends during more leisurely times (11 a.m. to 7 p.m.). Females are still using the bikes in the same pattern as males but not with the same frequency. At peak time there is a about a 3:1 ratio of men to women using the bike. For example when looking at Thursday at 6 p.m.: Male: 30,749 Female: 11,336

The highest number of users are male subscribers with the most popular day being Thursdays. Subscribers make up the majority of the busienss and usage of the bikes.

Descriptions:
The peak hours in August are in the morninng between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and in the evening between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. These are times with high commuter traffic which goes with the trend that a big customer group for the bikesharing program are urban commuters.

- The bikes are used the most during commuting times during the weekdays and in the afternoons on weekends.
- The average trip duration is short, around 10 minutes. 
- The areas that are most popular are in the center of the city, where there is high traffic and a reliance of public transportation. 
- Bikes provide a way for people to commute to/from work quickly, outdoors, and avoid mass transit (subways) 
- Bikes provide a way for people to enjoy and move quickly about the city on weekends while avoiding mass transit. 

### Suggestions for future analysis:
- Look at highly populated areas of Des Moines (high commuter area, tourist areas, etc.)
- Look at revenue from bikesharing groups
- Look at cost to own and repair a bike vs. average income a bike will generate.
